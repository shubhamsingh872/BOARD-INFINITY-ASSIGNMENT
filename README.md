### **Components Documentation**

- **Modal Component**:
  Purpose: The Modal component is used for updating or deleting tasks. It opens as a modal dialog when a task is being edited or deleted.
  Props: Receives onClose, isOpen, task, and setTask to control the modal's behavior and manage the task data.
  State Management: Uses Redux to dispatch actions for updating or deleting tasks.

- **Task List Component**:
  Purpose: The TaskList component displays a list of tasks filtered by their status.
  Props: Receives status to filter the tasks displayed.
  State Management: Uses useSelector to access the tasks from the Redux store

- **Tasks Input Component**:
  Purpose: The TaskInput component handles the creation of new tasks with a form that accepts the task's name, status, and description.
  State Management: Uses useState for local state and useDispatch for Redux actions.
  Validation: Displays an error message if the task name is empty.
- **Greetings Component**:
  Purpose: The Greeting component displays a greeting based on the time of day along with the current date.
  Props: None.
  Output: A styled header that changes greetings according to the time (e.g., "Good morning", "Good afternoon").

### **State Management**

- **Redux Store**: The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management. The global state is managed in the `store.js` file, and individual pieces of state, like tasks, are managed in slices.

- **Tasks Slice**: The `tasksSlice.js` handles the core actions for managing tasks in the application.

#### Actions:

**addTask**: Adds a new task to the state.
**updateTask**: Updates an existing task based on its id.
**deleteTask**: Removes a task from the state by its id.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed [here](https://todo-react-app.vercel.app/).
